            <h2 class="animate-on-scrole">Materials Needed for Your Dog Ghost Costume</h2>
            
            <p>
                Before diving into the fun, gather these supplies:
            </p>    
           
                <ul>
                    <li>A white bedsheet or piece of white fabric (lightweight and breathable)</li>
                    <li>Scissors</li>
                    <li>Measuring tape</li>
                    <li>Fabric glue or sewing kit (needle/thread or sewing machine)</li>
                    <li>Fabric marker or chalk</li>
                    <li>Optional: black fabric paint, Velcro strips, extra fabric for accessories</li>
                </ul>

            <p>Pro Tip: You can find all these materials at local craft stores like 
                Michaels Crafts.</p>
            
            <h2 class="animate-on-scrole"> Step-by-Step: How to Make a DIY Dog Ghost Costume</h2>
             <h3>1. Measure and Cut the Base Fabric</h3>
            <p>Lay the white fabric flat and gently drape it over your dog‚Äôs back, 
                aligning it from their shoulders to their tail. Use chalk or a marker 
                to outline a loose-fitting ghost shape that gives your dog enough 
                legroom.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‚úÇÔ∏è Cut along the traced outline carefully to avoid jagged edges.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Mark and Cut Leg Openings</h3>
               
            <p>While your dog stands calmly, mark the spots where their front legs go. 
                Cut small, rounded holes on both sides, ensuring they‚Äôre roomy but not 
                too loose.
            </p>
            <p>üêæ Safety Tip: Avoid cutting too close to your dog‚Äôs body‚Äîcomfort comes first!</p>
            
            
           
            <h3>3. Adjust the Fit and Shape</h3>
            <p>
                Drape the costume again and check the fit. Trim excess fabric and shape 
                the edges so the ghostly drape flows naturally around your dog‚Äôs body 
                without restricting movement.
            </p>
            <p>These small tweaks go a long way in making your dog costume fully rain-ready.</p>

            
            <h3>4. Add Optional Accessories</h3>
            <p>Want to boost the cuteness factor?</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><h4>Craft a mini hat or cape from leftover white fabric</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Sew or glue accessories in place</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Use soft, pet-safe materials</h4></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Accessories make your dog‚Äôs costume more unique and Instagram-worthy!</p>

           
            <h3>5. Paint on the Ghostly Face</h3>
            <p>
                Let your creativity shine! Use black fabric paint or markers to draw fun facial features like:
                <ul>
                    <li><h4>Big cartoon eyes</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>A smiling or spooky mouth</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Eyebrows or even blush spots</h4></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Be sure to let the paint dry fully before dressing your dog!</p>

            
            <h3>6. Secure with Velcro Strips</h3>
            <p>
                To prevent the costume from slipping off during walks or playtime, 
                attach adhesive Velcro strips underneath the belly or around the chest. 
                This ensures a snug but comfy fit.
            </p>
            
           
            <h3>7. Test and Make Final Adjustments</h3>
            <p>
                Try the costume on your pup and let them walk, sit, and wag. Look for 
                signs of discomfort or areas that need trimming. Make any adjustments to 
                ensure they feel great and look even better!
            </p>

            <p>Final Check: Your dog should be able to move freely and safely. If they seem agitated or restricted, tweak the fit again.</p>
